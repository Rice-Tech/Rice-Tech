### Hello, I'm Matt Rice
I'm a full stack developer currently focused on React. I build the tools that I want to use, ranging from a PWA to help the school I teach at run dismissal more efficiently, to an app to help my ultramarathon crew, to a utility to make SVG morph animations for the credits sequence of a movie I produced.
